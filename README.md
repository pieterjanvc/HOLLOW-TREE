# The HOLLOW TREE project

## **H**arnessing **O**nline **L**earning with **L**LM **O**riented **W**eb-apps for **T**eaching, **R**esearch, **E**valuation, and **E**ngagement

This project aims to explore the use of large language models (LLMS, e.g. ChatGPT) in
the higher-education classroom by providing students a way of checking their knowledge
on specific topics by interacting with a chatbot that has been configured and scoped by
course instructors to fit the course content.

This repository holds the source code for two web-based Python Shiny apps that will help
accomplish this goal:

## SCUIRREL - Student facing app

### Science Concept Understanding with Interactive Research RAG Educational LLM

This is the student facing application where users will interact with the LLM (i.e.
SCUIRREL) to explore the concepts of a specific topic by means of a guided conversation.
In addition to the conversation, students can take instructor verified quiz-questions to
test their knowledge

## ACCORNS - Instructor facing app

### Admin Control Center Overseeing RAG Needed for SCUIRREL

This application is the backend to SCUIRREL where instructors can set-up, manage and
monitor the topics and concepts that SCUIRREL will be able to discuss with students.

- I'm a [student](docs/student.md) wanting to know how I can use SCUIRREL to help me in
  my learning
- I'm an [instructor](docs/instructor.md) interested in exploring a use for an app like
  this my classroom and how to set it up
- I'm an [IT admin](docs/ITadmin.md) assisting in hosting and deploying these apps
- I'm a [developer](docs/developer.md) interested in how these app were built and play
  around with the code
- I'm a [researcher](docs/researcher.md) looking to analyse any of the data collected by
  the apps

## A bit more about the project and the motivation behind it

The idea for this project came from the observation that in many higher education
courses students come in with very diverse backgrounds and have different levels of
understanding of the topics being discussed in the classroom. Instructors often need to
spend valuable class time getting everyone on the same page, which can be frustrating
for both the students who are already familiar with the material and the ones who are
struggling to keep up.

The goal of this project is to provide a tool that can help students check their
understanding of the material outside of class time, and to provide instructors with a
way to monitor and guide this process. The hope is that this will help to level the
playing field for students with different levels of background knowledge, and to free up
more class time for discussion and activities that can help students deepen their
understanding of the material.

## Disclaimer

SCUIRREL and ACCORNS are experimental applications built as part of an ongoing research
project. They are not intended to be used as a replacement for traditional teaching
methods, but rather as a supplement to explore the potential of LLMs in the classroom
and collect data on the experience from both students and instructors.
