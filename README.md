# The HOLLOW TREE project

## **H**arnessing **O**nline **L**earning with **L**LM **O**riented **W**eb-apps for **T**eaching, **R**esearch, **E**valuation, and **E**ngagement

This project aims to explore the use of large language models (LLMS, e.g. ChatGPT) in
assisting students in the higher education classroom.

Instructors can upload relevant course materials and create revision topics which students will explore by having a conversation with a chatbot that will checks the students understanding of specific concepts related to the topic and correct them where needed. Additional multiple choice questions allow the students to test their understanding in a more structured way.

Meanwhile, instructors can collect data on every aspect of the student interaction with the chatbot and use this to evaluate the level of understanding of students, but also collect data on the effectiveness of LLMs in revising topics.
