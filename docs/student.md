# Welcome to SCUIRREL

SCUIRREL or Science Concept Understanding with Interactive Research RAG Educational LLM
is an AI course assistant that will help you check your knowledge on specific topics
through means of a guided conversation. Your course instructor will have set up the
topics and concepts that SCUIRREL will be able to discuss with you.

## Chatting with SCUIRREL

When you first open SCUIRREL you will be greeted with a welcome message and a list of
topics that you can choose from. SCUIRREL will lead the conversation by asking you a
series of questions about the topic you have chosen. Based on your answers, you will be
able to progress to the next concept on the topic which is visualised as a progress bar
at the top of the chat window.

## Quiz questions

In addition to the conversation, you will also be able to take quiz questions that your
instructor has set up for you on each topic. The questions are chosen at random and you
will be able to check your answer immediately together with an explanation why this
answer is correct or incorrect.

## Feedback

SCUIRREL is an experimental application that is trying to evaluate the use of large
language models (LLMs) in the classroom. Your feedback is very important to us and will
help us improve the application and figure out how we can best use it to help you in
your learning. There are two main ways you can provide feedback:

### Chat specific feedback

SCUIRREL has been configured to be as helpful as accurate as possible, but int he end is
just a large language model with a fancy wrapper around it. If at any point in the
conversation you feel SCUIRREL is not helpful, not providing incorrect information,
giving inappropriate responses etc., we like you to report this part of the conversation

1. Select all messages you want to report
2. Click the "Report" button at the top of the chat window
3. Fill in the feedback form and provide additional information if possible
4. Submit the form

### General feedback

On the right-hand side of SCUIRREL is a feedback button that allows you to provide
general feedback on the application itself (design, usefulness, bugs, etc.).

1. Click the general feedback button (right hand side of the screen)
2. Fill in the feedback form and provide additional information if possible
3. Submit the form

_NOTE: You will likely not receive a response to this feedback, but it will help us
fine-tune SCUIRREL and evaluate its effectiveness_

## Privacy and data collection

Depending on the configuration of SCUIRREL, you interactions might be any of the
following:

- Completely anonymous: Every session stats from scratch and there is no way to keep
  track of your progress
- Semi-anonymous: Your were provided a random ID that is used to keep track of your
  progress, but this ID is not linked to any personal information and your instructor
  cannot identify you as long as you are not providing any identifiable information in
  the chat or feedback
- Fully identifiable: You were asked to provide your name or student ID when given
  access to SCUIRREL. This information is visible to your instructor and any
  administrator or researchers who have been granted access to the data. This option
  does allow your instructor to potentially track your progress and provide more
  detailed feedback or guidance.

_IMPORTANT: In all cases, all of the chat messages you send to SCUIRREL are stored in a
secure database and can be accessed by your instructor. This is done to help your
instructor understand how you are interacting with SCUIRREL and how to improve its
performance or evaluate its educational effectiveness_

It is possible your data is used for research purposes, but this will always be done in
accordance with the institutional research protocols and your data will be anonymised
before being used in any research publication.
